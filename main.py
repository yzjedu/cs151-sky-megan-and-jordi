# Programmers: Megan, Jordi
# Course: Cs151, Professor Zee
# Due Date: 10/3/2024
# Lab Assignment: 3
# Problem statement: Make a program to calculate the distance traveled based on speed and /
# determine how many points the skier would receive if they went that distance.

# Data In: Code needs input the distance the skier wants to jump  in meter, the height of the jump in meter, the points per meter, /
# the par in meter, the skiers speed at the end of the jump,
# Data Out: How many points the skier will receive based on their distance traveled

# User should be prompted to enter five inputs: the height of the jump in meters, the skiers speed,

points_per_meter = 2
print('What is the type of ski jump?')
height_jump = float(input())
print('What is the skiers speed at the end of the jump in km/h?')
skiers_speed = float(input())
